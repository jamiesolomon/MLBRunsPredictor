# ModelingMLBTeams
This project iterates through various regression models for predicting the outcome of an MLB season.


Please run the cleaning file first, then modeling.

modeling takes a few minutes depending on your hardare specifications. Mainly the grid searches take the longest.

feel free to skip the mining process from MLB.com at thge end of the data cleaning file, i provided the csv file it produces as well.
